A simple admin panel I developed.
you can test it out http://yezid-panel.herokuapp.com/
the admin details are: admin@admin.com and password
It has the ability to:
Log in as admin(I seeded in the data).
Add Companies.
Add Employee to each Company(worked with db relationship).
Get either Data.
Perform CRUD functionality on both model
